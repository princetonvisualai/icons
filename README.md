We propose ICONS, a method for selecting vision-language data that optimizes training efficiency by identifying and prioritizing data samples that are consistently valuable across multiple tasks.

## News ðŸ”¥
- [01/25] We have released the LLAVA-ICONS-133K dataset on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xindiw/LLAVA-ICONS-133K) for public use.
- [12/24] We have released the paper [ICONS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00654).

## Installation

To set up the environment for ICONS, you can use the provided `environment.yml` file to create a Conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate icons
```

## Usage

The ICONS pipeline consists of two main stages:

### Stage 1: Specialist (Computing Task-Specific Influence)

1. **Compute Training Data Gradients**
   ```bash
   # Submit SLURM jobs for processing training data chunks
   sbatch './scripts/0_slurm_train_grads.sh' 500  # or use other checkpoints, here we use ckpt=500 as an example
   ```

2. **Merge Gradient Files**
   ```bash
   bash ./scripts/1_merge_train_gradient.sh
   ```

3. **Process Validation Data**
   ```bash
   bash ./scripts/2_get_val_data_grads_all.sh
   ```

4. **Compute Influence Matrices**
   ```bash
   bash ./scripts/3_specialist.sh
   ```

### Stage 2: Generalist (Influence Consensus)

5. **Generate Consensus**
   ```bash
   bash ./scripts/4_generalist.sh
   ```
